We won't make you implement any tests for this challenge, 
but we still want to see how you think about testing your code. 

If you WERE to implement tests for your function, what cases would you test?

List each case below in plain english with it's expected result. 

For example...
Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time
Expected Result: etc etc

Case 1: Viewer ID is empty
Expected Result: 400 response
(similar case for Recording ID empty)

Case 2: Viewer ID doesn't exist in the database
Expected result: 400 response
(similar case for Recording ID not existing in the database)

Case 3: User A views User B's recording x for the first time
Expected result: Unique view count for recording x is incremented by 1

Case 4: User A view User B's recording x for the nth time (n>1)
Expected result: No change in the database
